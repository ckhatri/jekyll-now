title: Week Five!

## What did I do this past week?
Finished up Netflix, turned that in. Paid attention in class like usual. Had Career Fair, which was pretty hectic along with the interviews that followed. Went to a Yeezy Concert, had a lot of fun.

## What's in my Way?
This week is still not as hectic. I've got an Algorithms exam on Wednesday. I've got a ton of coding challenges I need to finish along with interviews. I need to stay on top of all my other classes, which I've been slacking on (mainly online finance).

## What will you do next week?
I will spend all my time before my algorithms exam studying for the exam. After that I'm not entirely sure. I'll probably spend Thursday knocking out a bunch of interview questions and coding challenges. I'll also probably start studying for the OOP exam that's next week. Finish up all my readings. Catch up on my online Finance class. 

## Personal Class Experience
Taking quizzes this week went well I was pretty happy, lets hope this streak keeps going. 

Lecture is enjoyable always. Listened in class and was entertained by Downing as usual. Loved the JPL talk that we got on Wednesday, learned a lot about industry. Actually decided to apply to JPL, hoping to get a response. The VR/Augmented reality stuff they're doing is amazing! Really enjoying all the information I'm learning and reading in the textbook. 

## Quick Tip
Use vimtutor to learn about Vim. I decided to give it a go and it worked out very well! Takes about 30 minutes, but you learn the basics of vim, which is pretty awesome.
