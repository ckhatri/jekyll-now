## What did I do this past week?
I finally was able to get a 5/5 on an OOP quiz I was pretty happy. Started on Netflix. Started practicing pointer and reference stuff so I won't be tripped up by that again. 

## What's in my Way?
My next week is pretty hectic. I have two projects due Thursday night, one of them being Netflix. I have algo homework due on Wednesday, and I have Career fair. On Wednesday night I'm going to a Kanye West concert. I'm trying to finish everything by Tuesday night so I can properly enjoy Wednesday night and the day after. I think Career Fair will take a lot of time. Interview prep and the interviews that follow Career Fair take a lot of time as well.

## What will you do next week?
I will try finishing all my homework on Tuesday night. I will make the most of Career Fair. I will have fun at Yeezy. I might have to spend all my time locked in this weekend, but it'll be worth it. 

## Personal Class Experience
Taking quizzes this week went well I was pretty happy, lets hope this streak keeps going. 

Lecture is enjoyable always, but the experience of quizzes seems to dampen my day a little. Listened in class and was entertained by Downing as usual. Loved the Bloomberg talk that we got on Wednesday, learned a lot about industry. Really enjoying all the information I'm learning and reading in the textbook. 

## Quick Tip
Look for a good LaTeX resume format, your resume will look nice and clean and all you'll need to do is fill in information. A nice looking resume might not really do anything, but it is pretty nice. Plus with LaTeX you can adjust margins and whatnot pretty easily.
