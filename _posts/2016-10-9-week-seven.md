## What did I do this past week?
Did a lot of interview prep for my interviews last week. Along with interview prep I studied for the OOP exam, which I was pretty worried about. 

The exam itself went...OK I think. I had took a rather long winded approach to two of the problems, which cost me time, and when I realized the easiest solution there was a about a minute left and I did not have time to fix my mistakes. Here's hoping to a good grade! But we'll see what happens.

## What's in my Way?
Algorithms homework due Wednesday and a lot more interviews. I've just been cranking out coding questions over and over because I need to. Hoping all this hard work pays off with a great internship which will further my career! What's in my way is nervousness, I get incredibly nervous before interviews (and exams) and perform worse, but I think everyone does.

## What will you do next week? 
Study study study. Pay attention in class. Study some more. Crank out the object oriented programming assignment. Do my interviews. Study. Gym. Study. Maybe sleep.

## Personal Class Experience
Last week was pretty relaxed, but we still learned a lot. I loved the paintball analogy that Downing gave. If there was a question on the exam, I feel like I definitely would remember it all. Downing is funny as hilarious, and entertaining as usual. 

## Quick Tip
I've been using leetcode to do some interview prep questions. I like it a lot, HackerRank is nice as well.
