title: Week Two!
---

## What did I do this past week?
I read the readings for class and then sat in class. I learned about Longhorn Startup last Friday which seems like an incredible opportunity which I'm thinking about applying for, and even if I don't get in I'm planning on just sitting in. I read over the spec for Collatz, set up Travis AI, and started reading through the project and what is necessary to complete it. 

## What's in my Way?
I know more C++ than last week however I still feel like this might keep me behind in the class and so I've decided to sprint through a book called "A Tour of C++" which I've started and will hopefully finish by Monday. I also am trying to find time to prepare myself for career fair and the interviews that will be coming up in the next few weeks.

## What will you do next week?
Well, I've been trying to finish all my assignments for this upcoming week by Monday. After I do that, I will get a head start on my assignments for the weeks coming up, which will hopefully give me a buffer. Once I have this buffer I can focus my time and energy on career fair and preparation. 

## Personal Class Experience
Last Friday I had a lot of fun learning about Exceptions, I'm not entirely sure why I would ever say that...but I just did. The analogies that Downing comes up with in class are both hilarious, and very memorable. Thanks to these analogies I understand that exceptions are a happy medium between asserts and the alternatives of global variables signaling errors. I guess you can say his lecture on exceptions is *exceptionally* done. Haha. I'll show myself out. 

## Quick Tip
The Pomodoro Technique has been my go to strategy for years and has always kept my focused while doing work. The way it works is you set a timer for 25 minutes, and then take a five minute break. You repeat these four times and then take a longer break (usually 15 minutes). You can try this out on multiple sites such as [tomato-timer](http://tomato-timer.com/)
