title: Week Eight!

## What did I do this past week?
Paid attention in class as usual. Started working on the Allocator project. Finding a partner took a bit, but luckily I got one. We've finished up to allocate so far, hoping the coalesce part won't be too bad. I had four interviews last week, so school was a bit hectic. I read the readings, I took quizzes. Worked on some HackTX stuff. 

## What's in my Way?
I have an information retrieval exam this Tuesday in class. My professor is gone on a trip so there's no office hours this week. I haven't been paying attention in class, which means that this exam basically requires me to go through all the slides myself and learn everything. This is the first class I have consistently gone to, but haven't paid attention in. It's really biting me in the ass. So I need to get the grind going and learn everything. I'm flying out Thursday night for onsite interviews also. I've also gotten a bit of a cold so I'm sick and have been sleeping a lot to get over it. 

## What will you do next week? 
Study study study. Pay attention in class. Study some more. Go into the info retrieval exam and hopefully do well. Study some more. Crank out the OOP Project. Not go to the gym because I'm sick. Study. Sleep so I can get over my cold. Prepare for my onsite interview. 

## Personal Class Experience
Last week was pretty relaxed, but we still learned a lot. We're moving onto data structures at this point and how they work. Downing is entertaining and class goes by fast as usual. 

## Quick Tip
F.lux is a god send for me. What it does is it dims your screen so it's less bright at night and more natural for your eyes to look at. Apparently blue light messes up with your sleep system and tells your brain to stay up. So it's better for your eyes and your sleep schedule. Download it [here](https://justgetflux.com/)
