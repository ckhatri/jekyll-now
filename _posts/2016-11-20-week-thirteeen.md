## What did I do this past week?
Well last week I survived. I finished my IR project on the plane ride home from my interview on Monday which was really nice, although I wasn't able to test it until I got off the plane since I needed internet to spider. Luckily it ran right the first time, so that was great. I heard back from my interviews and got an offer with TripAdvisor so I'm pretty excited for that! I finished my algorithms homework on the plane as well. Worked on the Life project and finished that on Wednesday night which was pretty nice. Submitted it on Thursday after cleaning up the code and writing unit tests. 

## What's in my Way?
This week is pretty chill with Thanksgiving, I'll be heading back on Tuesday after my IR class. The week after this will be pretty bad though with final exams and projects that are due on the last day of class. So I'll probably be spending my Thanksgiving getting work done.  

## What will you do next week? 
Go to class and pay attention. Head home for Thanksgiving and take a little break but get a lot of work done over the break.  

## Personal Class Experience
Class was great like usual. We had Spiceworks come in and give a talk which I really enjoyed. Allowed me to learn more about the company and how software development is in the real world. I thought the quiz on Friday would be over Spiceworks but that wasn't the case. More inheritance stuff. 

## Quick Tip
Playing around with Google's QuickDraw was pretty fun. Check it out [here](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/)
