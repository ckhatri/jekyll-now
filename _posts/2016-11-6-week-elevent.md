title: Week Eleven!

## What did I do this past week?
I didn't Q-drop the class this week, that was pretty great. But because I didn't Q-drop the class, and since I hadn't started Darwin because I knew I might be q-dropping, I hadn't even worked on Darwin till the Q-Drop deadline. On Wednesday I had an algorithms exam which is what I spent most of my Tuesday studying for. So that left two days to finish and turn in Darwin. Luckily we did. We finished around 9:30, after catching a bug due to a typo in our code. We quickly pushed everything and submitted the files, then checked and checked again to make sure everything was good. I also paid attention in class, learned more about the difference between Java and C++ along with move() and what it does. 

## What's in my Way?
This week I have interviews and some are onsites! Flying out always is a bit much, and losing an entire day to interviews kinda shoots your productivity. So I just need to make sure I finish all my work, and adjust accordingly. I usually try to finish up quite a bit of my week's work but I went to Houston this weekend and basically did nothing productive. 

## What will you do next week? 
Interviews. Study for OOP and try to get a streak of all 5's from now on. Finish up all my work. Pay attention in class. The usual.

## Personal Class Experience
Class was interesting as usual, Downing makes us jump when he yells "Highlight of the whole class" really excitedly. C++ seems to give the programmer a lot of power. I still don't get the construction stuff, I really need to just sit down and play around with the code.

## Quick Tip
I recently downloaded this app on Android called 7 weeks. Studies show that if you can keep a habit going for at least 7 weeks straight, it'll firmly become a habit and much less easier to shake off. There are a lot of habit apps out there. If you're interested in reading how habits are formed, why they're formed or how to break them I'd recommend reading The Power of Habit.
