## What did I do this past week?
I finished up the programming assignment on Monday. Made sure everything was OK, and then called it a night. The next morning after reviewing my code I realized there was a bug, and fixed it. After all this was done I then pushed everything, and made a pull request for the tests I wrote. On Wednesday I checked (repeatedly) if everything was in order. I freaked out when a Travis CI build started failing. Luckily everyone in the class was having this issue, and the Travis CI people reverted the change they made that broke the builds. After this was done, I made a push again to make sure my Travis CI worked again, which it did. At this point I turned in my project.

## What's in my Way?
My grades on quizzes for this class aren't going too well. I need to get used to doing better under a time constraint and pressure. I usually get hung up on the first question, and then Canvas pops up telling me "Hey this will be submitted in thirty seconds". At that point I freak out, usually, and pick my best choice and go on to the second question. Due to my low limit on time, I usually am forced to guess on the second as well if I don't outright know the answer. I also need to do more interview preparation. 

## What will you do next week?
Well, I've been trying to finish all my assignments for this upcoming week by Monday. After I do that, I will get a head start on my second assignment with my partner which we'll be starting on Monday, which will hopefully give me a buffer. I will make sure to do all readings and make sure my concepts are strong so that I can do better on quizzes. 

## Personal Class Experience
Taking quizzes this week didn't go too well. Being stuck on a question is a horrible feeling since you know time is ticking down (and you don't have a lot of time to begin with), and knowing you can't go back to an answer after you go to the next question. I'm used to reading through all problems, and then tackling the easiest ones and then going from there. In this case I can't do that and if the first question is hard I get stuck. This tilts me for the rest of the quiz because I'm low on time and already in a bad mindset. 

Lecture is enjoyable always, but the experience of quizzes seems to dampen my day a little.

## Quick Tip
I didn't know git --amend is a thing.  Git --amend lets you change the commit message of your last commit. It works wonders. I used it multiple times for the project when I forgot to tag issues like "closes issue #24" in my commits.
